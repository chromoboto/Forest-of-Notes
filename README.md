# Forest of Notes
The forest is created by representing the notebook structure of topics, subtopics and notes as a stored javascript object. Then that object is parsed in realtime and transpiled into the language of the forest. Topics become trees with the associated subtopics as its branches and the individual notes as its leaves. The collection of topics form the forest.

The forest spins so that the user can interact and explore, clicking on leaves to read the note it represents.
